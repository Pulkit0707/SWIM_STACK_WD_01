                        <p class=" text-center">The Mamba Mentality, famously coined by the legendary basketball player Kobe Bryant, encapsulates a mindset characterized by an unwavering dedication to excellence, relentless work ethic, and an unyielding desire to constantly improve. 
                            Inspired by the agile and deadly Black Mamba snake, this mentality reflects Kobe's approach to the game of basketball and life. It emphasizes the importance of embracing challenges, pushing one's limits, and maintaining a fierce focus on goals.
                            Mamba Mentality goes beyond sports, serving as a powerful philosophy applicable to various aspects of life. It encourages individuals to approach their endeavors with determination, resilience, and a commitment to continuous growth.
                            Kobe Bryant's legacy extends beyond the basketball court, leaving behind a timeless lesson in the pursuit of greatness through the embodiment of the Mamba Mentality.</p>

                <h1 class="text-center my-2">Court Rules</h1>
                <p class="my-2">In basketball there are rules that are written down that you cannot do. Rules like no traveling, fouls, and not using enhancing performance drugs. As these rules make the game fair for everybody, there are three unwritten rules that players follow to show respect for the game.
                    Let’s say your team has the ball and you are up by 20 points with 10 seconds left on the clock. You, your teammates, and your opponents all have stopped playing and accepted their fate. You have the ball, and you are wide open. Do you A: shoot the shot or do you B: Just don’t shoot and let the clock wind down. If you picked A, you are the reason why a fight started between the players. This unwritten rule is when the game is already decided, do not run up the score and put the ball in the basket. Players like LeBron James and Joel Embiid have stated in times past that doing that doesn’t show respect for the game
                    The game is over, and your team just lost a game by 50 points. You are upset over this loss, and you just want to go to the locker room and be by yourself. But to show respect for the game, you go to the team that just whooped your butt, and shake their hands and say, “good game.” This isn’t a rule that the NBA enforces but the players take it to heart if you decide to not shake their hands after the game
                    The last unwritten rule is you are not supposed to jump on the free throw line. We see players not jumping when they go to the line, but this is not a written rule. This is an unwritten rule that players do because jumping will cause them to miss because of the lack of momentum when you are just standing there.</p>
